# Machine_Learning_Breast_Cancer_Detection


This project uses a Decision Tree algorithm to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant based on a dataset of tumor features. The model is trained on labeled data, and its performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy and precision. The goal is to provide a reliable and interpretable model for early cancer detection.
